# unitary-test
A given matrix $ U $  is [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix) if the product of $U$ and its hermitian conjugate $U^\dag$ is the identity matrix ${1\kern-0.25em\text{l}}$.

This short program tests whether a given matrix (inputed as a nested array in Python) is unitary.
