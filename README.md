# matrix tests
This is a short program that contains tests whether a given matrix has the following properties:

## [Unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix)
A matrix $U$ is _unitary_ if $UU^{\dagger}=U^{\dagger}U=I$, where $U^\dagger$ is the hermitian conjugate and $I$ is the identity matrix.

## [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix)
A matrix $U$ is _hermitian_ is $U^\dagger=U$, where $U^\dagger$ is the hermitian conjugate.

## [Idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent_matrix)
A matrix $U$ is _idempotent_ if $U^2=U$. If a matrix is both hermitian and idempotent, it is known as a _projection matrix_.
